Hi! 

I am @AcademyHill, and I am a computer engineer hoping to use Github to help people learn how to use various electronics platforms such as FPGA's, Arduinos,
and Raspberry Pi's. In fact, this account and this readme file were created using my Raspberry Pi!

At this time, I have not created any repositories. I also probably won't create any repositories any time soon. I am hoping that by the fall of 2021, I will 
finally be ready to really start posting some of the projects I am working on here on Github for everyone to learn from and enjoy. For a sneak peek at some of
the things I will start with, my favorite device to work with at this time is definitely my Digilent Arty S7 FPGA. I love digital circuit design, and most of
my professional work will be in the field of digital circuits. So, my first project will probably be a set of open source IP cores written in VHDL for very 
basic building blocks such as counters, registers, rectangular pulse generators, pwm generators, etc. I may also post a list of my favorite textbooks from my
extensive and ever growing library.

Stay tuned, and I hope that this profile will one day be viewed as fondly as I view other creatives such as Electroboom, EEVBlog, Michael Margolis, or Simon Monk.
